- The gateway has been rewritten to use Accept.js (rather than SIM/hosted payment page with relay); customer now stays on-site to enter their credentials.

- Auth.net now receives the MODX user ID and invoice number
- Removed properties to change endpoints; new API endpoints are hardcoded (based on test/live mode)
- Removed MD5 Hash Secret property
